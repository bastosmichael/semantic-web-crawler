To Test it out, simply run the command 

./SWC/Debug/SWC http://michaelbastos.com

This will just download the webpage and cache it, to use an argument then do the following

./SWC/Debug/SWC http://michaelbastos.com '<li>.*</li>' 

This will not only download the page and cache it, it will then parse it for any statements inside of <li> brackets...
